A result oriented self-taught fullstack javascript developer.

Passion for programming since ever started learning it.

When working on something I make sure to do my best to deliver the expected output.

My curiosity leads me to understanding how things work internally.

Always evolving and always learning, for me learning is a lifetime journey that I enjoy.

Feeding on challenges, and problem solving is a part of my mentality.

Believing that failure is a part of the recipe of being successful.
